Java Developer Internship - Interview Questions (Answers)

1. What is method overloading?
Method overloading is when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters. It allows methods to perform similar tasks with different input.

2. How do you handle divide-by-zero?
You handle divide-by-zero using a conditional check before performing the division to avoid runtime errors or invalid results.

3. Difference between == and .equals()?
'==' compares the reference (memory address) of objects, whereas '.equals()' compares the actual content or value of objects.

4. What are the basic data types in Java?
The basic data types in Java are byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean.

5. How is Scanner used for input?
The Scanner class is used to get user input from the console. You create a Scanner object and call methods like nextInt(), nextLine(), etc., to read values.

6. Explain the role of a loop.
A loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. It helps in automating repetitive tasks.

7. Difference between while and for loop?
A 'for' loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known. A 'while' loop is used when the condition needs to be checked before each iteration, and the number of iterations may not be known.

8. What is the JVM?
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a part of the Java platform that executes Java bytecode and enables platform independence.

9. How is Java platform-independent?
Java is platform-independent because the compiled bytecode can run on any device that has the JVM installed, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.

10. How do you debug a Java program?
Debugging in Java involves identifying and fixing errors using tools like print statements, IDE debuggers, breakpoints, and reading exception messages.
